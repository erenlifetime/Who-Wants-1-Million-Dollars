There are 10 questions and leave time to think

I recommend you to play this game with thought.
  # Parameters
  
  This Project was made to MVVM(Model-View & View-Model) 
  
  [QuizView.swift] Differences between Class and Structure are resolved, function and mutation function are also resolved
  
  [QuizView.swift] i created four button for my answers and i gave their names also gave labels
  
  [QuizView.swift] When i pressed the button i didn't go to the next page so i created a function with float and i used to question number / question count
  
  [QuizView.swift] i checked the answers with function and also used Boolean( return true and false)
  
  [ViewController.swift] After understanding the green or red color of the background, we move on to the next section, which is clearly seen.
  
  [ViewController.swift] I noticed that the questions did not change when we clicked the button. I solved the problem with updateUI.
